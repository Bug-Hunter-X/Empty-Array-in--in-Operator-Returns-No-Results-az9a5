# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents when the array is empty, acting as a no-op,  but instead it returns no results.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code uses the `$in` operator with an empty array. Instead of returning all documents as one might expect, the query returns an empty result set. This is counterintuitive to how a "contains any of" operator should function when given an empty set.

## Solution

The solution is to explicitly handle the case of an empty array. If the array is empty, construct a query that matches all documents. This ensures the desired behavior regardless of the input array.
